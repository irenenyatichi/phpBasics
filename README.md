# phpBasics ReadMe.
Learning php from scratch. My main site of reference is https://www.phptpoint.com/php-introduction/. 
I have used other sites like:
    https://www.expertphp.in/
    https://www.webtrainingroom.com/
    https://www.educba.com/swapping-in-php/
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php-tutorials/
These are my notes. Will later do a project and add the link to the repository here.
